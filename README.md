## Getting Started

Download links:

From Github: https://github.com/tcrurav/express-jest-supertest.git

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/express-jest-supertest.git
```

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned the project install all dependencies.

```
cd express-jest-supertest/backend
npm install
```

You need a backend/.env file. You can use the backend/.env.example file:

```
cd express-jest-supertest/backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the project:

```
cd express-jest-supertest/backend
npm start
```

You can use the POSTMAN link to create a user with the API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3446841/2sAYQanrW4
